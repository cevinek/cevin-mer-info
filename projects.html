					<div class="page_content">
						The <b>MEILI Travel Diary</b> is an open-source highly modular system for the collection and annotation of travel diaries of multiple users. The system contains two main components: the Mobility Collector, which was presented at the <a href="http://cartogis.ugent.be/mobileghent/sessions/mobility-collector-battery-conscious-mobile-tracking"> Mobile Ghent 2013</a> conference, and the Web Diary, which was presented at the the <a href="mobilitylab.ut.ee/mobiletartu/2016/"> Mobile Tartu 2016</a> conference.

						Project status: Ongoing

				<h3 class="page_title">SPOT 2</h3>
					<div class="page_content">
											<b>SPOT 2</b> investigates how the data collected during the SPOT 1 project can be used. Some of the topics of interest are the following: 
											<br />
											1. The stability and variability of individuals’ day-to-day choices. This includes analysing the tendency
												and degree of variability and stability of their chosen travel modes, activity locations, individual’s time
												allocations and trip chaining behaviours, across different groups of travellers.
												<br />
											2. The comparability of standard transport model indicators and assumptions with GPS based
											observations. This includes comparing the individual’s revealed multimodal and route choices with
											hypothetical shortest path and multimodal assumptions which are commonly used in urban transport
											modelling.
											<br />
											3. Exploring space-time accessibility factors that shape and influence individual travel decisions. The
											individual activity-travel pattern that was collected from the survey is a result from trade-off between
											individual’s travel needs and constraints.

						Project status: Ongoing.

					<div class="page_content">
											<b>SPOT Gothenburg</b> studies the feasibility of using the MEILI system in a new and untested region (Gothenburg, Sweden) with the end goal of collecting how a small sample of users (around 40) travels for a week.

					<div class="page_content">
											<b>SPOT 1</b> studies if an application installed on a smartphone equipped with
											GPS can be used to replacement or supplement a traditional travel diary. The advantages and disadvantages
											of traditional travel diaries as well as the new method are discussed compared. The	methods are implemented in the same city, at the same time and with the same respondents using
											both methods to facilitate the comparison.

				<h3 class="page_title">Space Time Alarm Clock</h3>
					<div class="page_content">
						<b>Space Time Alarm Clock</b> (STAC) is an Android application designed to help you get to a destination in time with minimal interaction. It does so by continuously 1) identifying possible moves from your current location, 2) showing, for each move, how long it will take to reach the destination if it is taken, and 3) alerting when no move will lead you to the destination in time.

				<h3 class="page_title">Open Science Map</h3>
					<div class="page_content">
						<b>OpenScienceMap</b> provides free and open maps for Android with the fastest and 100% pure vector maps around. It is a platform used to enable researchers to implement their ideas, to cooperate with others, and to share their results with everybody.
					<br /> <br />
						Project status: I was hired as a research intern working on the project in June-September 2013 during my thesis. The Open Science Map project is ongoing.
